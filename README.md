# BTP400-BankServer

Banking application converted into a TCP socket-based client/server application

The server will handle multiple client connections and manage a bank of accounts.
A client program uses a console-based window to interact with the server.

Testing
1. Use port number 5678 and localhost for testing purpose.
2. Use three command prompt windows to run two clients and the bank server. 
In the bank server window, there should be echo output whenever the server has processed a client request.
